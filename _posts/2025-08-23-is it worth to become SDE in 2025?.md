Absolutely, but whether it’s “worth it” depends on what you value most in a career. Let’s break it down carefully as of June 2025.

1. Job Market & Demand

High demand: Software engineering (SWE) continues to be in demand globally. AI, cloud computing, cybersecurity, and mobile/web development are particularly hot areas.

Remote opportunities: Companies are still offering remote or hybrid work, which increases flexibility.

Competition: While demand is strong, top-tier roles (FAANG, top startups) are competitive and often require strong coding, system design, and sometimes AI/ML skills.

2. Salary & Compensation

Global average: SWE salaries are still above average in most countries. For example, in the U.S., median SWE salaries range from $110k–$150k for mid-level roles, with senior roles easily exceeding $200k.

Equity & perks: Startups and tech giants often include stock options, bonuses, and benefits.

Inflation considerations: Salaries have been keeping pace with cost of living in most developed markets, but you should check your local context.

3. Career Growth & Skills

SWE offers strong upward mobility: Senior Engineer → Tech Lead → Engineering Manager → CTO or Principal Engineer.

Transferable skills: Coding, problem-solving, system design, and AI/ML expertise are useful even outside traditional tech companies.

Learning curve: You need continuous learning due to fast-changing tech stacks (AI, cloud, Web3, etc.).

4. Work-Life Balance & Stress

SWE can be stressful in high-growth startups or high-pressure environments.

Big tech often provides flexible hours, but crunch times (product launches, deadlines) can be intense.

Remote and freelance SWE work can give more control over your schedule.

5. Future Trends (2025+)

AI Integration: AI tools like Copilot, ChatGPT, and others are transforming software development. You may need to adapt to AI-assisted coding.

Demand in specialized areas: AI/ML, cloud infrastructure, cybersecurity, and embedded systems are growing faster than general web development.

Automation Risk: Routine coding might get automated, so higher-level problem-solving, architecture, and AI-assisted development skills will be more valuable.

✅ Conclusion

Worth it? Yes, SWE is still a highly lucrative, in-demand, and flexible career in 2025.

Maximize value: Focus on areas with strong growth (AI, cloud, cybersecurity), develop problem-solving and system design skills, and stay adaptable.
